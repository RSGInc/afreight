# Master.R

### Initialize Application -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Load global variables
# Load current rFreight installation
# Check for new rFreight version, load rFreight and other packages, create output folder
# Load any other scripts of general functions for use in the model


### 1. Firm Synthesis ---------------------------- firm_sim.R

  # Enumerate firms
  # Allocate firms from TAZ1 (large zones) to TAZ2 (small zones) for region with small zones
  # Scale firms to TAZ1 (large zones) to TAZ2 (small zones)for this scenario
  # Simulate production commodities
  # Identify warehouses, producers, and maker sample
  # Identify input commodities needed for each firm
	  # FirmInputOutputPairs <- firm_sim_iopairs
	  # producers <- firm_sim_producers
	  # consumers <- firm_sim_consumers
	  # naics_set <- firm_sim_naics_set


### 2. Simulate Supply Chain --------------------- sc_sim.R

    # Process network skims into a set of mode choice model inputs describing modal travel times and distances
    ShipmentRoutes <- sc_sim_traveltimedistance

    # Calculate model costs and times for each shipment route - mode combination
    ShipmentRoutesCosts <- sc_sim_modalcosts

    # Create groups of producers and consumers
    AllFirms <- sc_sim_pmg(naics_set, ShipmentRoutesCosts = ShipmentRoutesCosts)

    # Select supplier firms for consuming firms
    BuyerSupplierPairs <- sc_sim_supplierselection

    # Apportion freight flows to buyer supplier pairs and weight to FAF data
    BuyerSupplierFlows <- sc_sim_apportionment

    # Determine distribution channel
    BuyerSupplierChannel <- sc_sim_distchannel

    # Determine shipment size
    BuyerSupplierShipmentSize <- sc_sim_shipmentsize

    # Mode choice
    # Process network skims into a set of mode choice model inputs describing modal travel times and distances
    ShipmentRoutes <- sc_sim_traveltimedistance

    # Calculate model costs and times for each shipment route - mode combination
    ShipmentRoutesCosts <- sc_sim_modalcosts

    # Determine Shipment mode
    BuyerSupplierMode <- sc_sim_shipmentmode

    # Complete shipment table with intermediate transfer locations added
    BuyerSupplierModeTransfer <- sc_sim_transferlocations

    # Add through trips to and from Import/Export nodes in the region
    InternationalThru <- sc_sim_internationalthru

    # Convert shipments to trips for aggregate assignment and for sampling for truck touring simulation
    ShipmentTripList <- sc_sim_trips
