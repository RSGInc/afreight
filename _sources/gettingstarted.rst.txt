Installation
------------

The following installation instructions are for Windows or Mac users.  ActivitySim is built
to run on one machine with sufficient available RAM to fit all required data and calculations
in memory.

Anaconda
~~~~~~~~

ActivitySim is a 64bit Python 2.7 library that uses a number of packages from the
scientific Python ecosystem, most notably `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`__
and `numpy <http://numpy.org>`__. ActivitySim does not currently support Python 3.

The recommended way to get your own scientific Python installation is to
install Anaconda_, which contains many of the libraries upon which
ActivitySim depends + some handy Python installation management tools.

Anaconda includes the ``conda`` command line tool, which does a number of useful
things, including creating `environments <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html>`__
(i.e. stand-alone Python installations/instances/sandboxes) that are the recommended
way to work with multiple versions of Python on one machine.  Using conda
environments keeps multiple Python setups from conflicting with one another.

After installing Anaconda, create an ActivitySim test environment
with the following commands:

::

    #Windows
    conda create -n asimtest python=2.7
    activate asimtest

    #Mac
    conda create -n asimtest python=2.7
    source activate asimtest

If you access the internet from behind a firewall, then you will need to configure your proxy
server. To do so, create a ``.condarc`` file in your Anaconda installation folder, such as:
::
    
    proxy_servers:
      http: http://proxynew.odot.state.or.us:8080
      https: https://proxynew.odot.state.or.us:8080
    ssl_verify: false

This will create a new conda environment named ``asimtest`` and set it as the
active conda environment.  You need to activate the environment each time you
start a new command session.  You can remove an environment with
``conda remove -n asimtest --all`` and check the current active environment with
``conda info -e``.
