rFreight 0.1-19
* Added the MAM family of functions for handling minutes-after-midnight data

* Added optional arguments lib and suppressWarnings to loadPackages function

rFreight 0.1-16

* Added FIPS.XXXXx tables, documentation, and supporting functions

rFreight 0.1-15
* Fixed bug in SCTGCodes "Description" field
* Added tidyDataTable function
* Added the getGlobalVars function
* run_sim now exports special rFreight global variables by default

rFreight 0.1-14
* Added the bucketRound function
* Further clean up of old data and documentation

rFreight 0.1-13
* joinSkimTables has additional input validation
* Added table of US counties and FIPS codes (Counties)
* Added table of SCTG codes (SCTGCodes)
* Added various NAICS and SCTG crosswalk tables (NAICS2007, NAICS2012, NAICS2007_to_SCTG, NAICS2012_to_SCTG, NAICS2007_to_NAICS2012, NAICS2012_to_NAICS2007)

rFreight 0.1-12
* Fixed a bug in run_sim that caused inputEnv to be exported twice when k > 1

rFreight 0.1-11
* Added copyTemplate and writeToExcelTemplate functions
* Users can specify input variables to exclude in run_sim

rFreight 0.1-10
* splitData is now roughly twice as fast when f is not NULL
* splitData will always return a (potentially unbalanced) split dataset when k is equal to the number of groups implied by f
* splitData performs more rigorous validation of f
* Fixed a bug in run_sim when FUN is in error and k is 1 where inputEnv is not removed from the search path
* Added createAppTemplate function

rFreight 0.1-9
* loadInputs now supports .R files

rFreight 0.1-8
* Added skim functions: convertSkimToMat, joinSkimTables
* Users are now able to set random seeds with run_sim
* Miscellaneous improvements

rFreight 0.1-7
* Monte Carlo classification is 50% faster

rFreight 0.1-6
* Added the progressEnd function
* Removed residual CMAP-specific datasets
* Removed residual deprecrated progress tracking functions/documentation
* Current progress tracking functions are more precise in their percent complete values
